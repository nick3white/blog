# Hi.

It's been 2 years that I've been not writing this.

Part of me was hoping that you would reach out and we'd get to talking and all of this would accidentally come tumbling out, but part of me was terrified of that, too. I could've reached out myself, but I couldn't do that innocently; I knew there were floodgates.

I was initially approaching this as an apology, but as I wrote, and the memories came flooding back, I remembered how many times I've apologized, and the flow got misdirected.  So, while a lot of this does amount to that, I'm going to approach it as something else.  Just a narrative of the things I've learned recently.

(Just in case the phrasing never actually happens, and in case the phrasing is important, I'm sorry I haven't been a great friend.   To everyone, probably, but definitely to you, and not just the days of proximation; those apologies have probably been said already.  The last 25 years I've been expecting you to do all the work, and that's just not that great.  There are reasons why, and I'll get there, but they're just reasons, that doesn't do much.  But insofar as an apology helps, this can be that.)
