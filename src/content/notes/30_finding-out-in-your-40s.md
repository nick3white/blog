When When Zack was born, things were bad. Really bad. Possibly the worst time in my life -- and you've seen some of the worst times of my life, so you have a sense for the benchmark.

Not just having a doctor come out after surgery with his head in his hands, saying "there's nothing more we can do," but, maybe even worse, was the moment when, we replied, what if we took him to Boston Children's Hospital, and the doctor said something like "oh, yeah, then he'd probably be fine." Like, this dude was going to let him die, rather than suggest we take him to a better hospital. Seriously what the fuck.

It's hard enough to have a kid with disabilties and health problems, but we also had to be fucking prescient in order to manage his care. The health insurance companies don't know what Williams Syndrome is, and they don't give a shit; if htey bothered to find out, they might have to pay for his healthcare, so, better to be ignorant I guess? If you're curious, open heart surgery on a 3 month old costs about $750,000. Thank god for autism -- it's so common, and the advocacy is so strong, there are legally mandated treatments that they have to cover -- and they overlap a lot with WS treatments. So when Zack was diagnosed with autism, a lot of the therapy coverage got a lot easier.

Lori and I still debate whether he actually has it. It's hard to say at his age, and I'm not sure it matters. The doctors know more about it than we do, and they diagnosed it, so, who cares.

It made me curious though - I honestly didn't really know anything about autism, apart from the memes from the early internet days -- back before 4chan went nazi, I spent a lot of time on /g/, the technology board there. Autism memes were all the rage -- but that was about all I knew about it. Autistic people all run arch linux, they don't bathe, they don't have any friends.

When I started looking into autism a couple of years ago, I found out that a lot of that was pretty accurate: they tend to find a "special interest" and go really deep into it - ie, run their computers with highly time-intensive operating systems; they really do have hygiene issues sometimes due to a lack of understanding, or respect for, all those social rules we're supposed to follow; they don't do well at maintaining long term relationships because they don't understand the necessity of the work involved -- or even what that work is.

It was weird, learning all that, because, like, I run arch linux. I'm...not great about showering. I've had a lot of long term friendships just kinda stop, and I never really knew why. The thing that really slapped me in the face was when one person with autism said a common thing they had heard was, "how can someone so smart be so dumb."

In about 2008 I was diagnosed with ADHD, but I just kinda didn't bother with treatment. I wasn't sleeping well back then, so the ADHD meds destroyed my already tattered "sleep hygeine". Now, though - a parent of 3, exhausted as I am, I haven't had trouble falling asleep in years, but the focus issues have become more prominent. So I signed myself up for another ADHD diagnosis session. Because of the potential for abuse, they're pretty strict about diagnosis; I went to a special neuro center and they just did a whole rundown. So I just asked them to test for autism too. And, so, yeah. Turns out I'm autistic.
