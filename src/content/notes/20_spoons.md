I lived as a ghost for a long time. It started when I was really young; after the 3rd move, I finally understood what communities were, and that they were things that just weren't going to be a part of my life. I tried, with certain kids; I tried and tried, well beyond when I should've stopped. And sometimes they'd be nice to me, but, once we were around their other friends, it was back to calling me a faggot, or, in jr high, locking me in lockers. (They weren't typical lockers, they were these big square cage-like things, walls of steel woven like dense chainlink, painted a blue so dark it looked black. Inescapable, but decent airflow.) I knew I wasn't going to be a part of the various communities I came across. I didn't understand them, and they seemed like they were fine without me. It's like sitting in the park, watching squirrels play. They're cute, sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, but, you'd never think to go play with them, it just wouldn't occur to you.

I probably told you about the last birthday party I had -- I forget what grade, somewhere between 4th and 6th -- no one came. I say that, but that leaves out the one person that did come, the only person I should've invited -- he was always there, he was an actual friend. I don't think I consciously appreciated that at the time, but it was around then that I stopped trying with those other kids. (I don't count him as having come to my party because he was there before the party and would've been there regardless of whether there had been a party. I took him for granted a bit, for sure, but I always went to his parties, too -- though he had the sense not to invite anyone else.)

Jack and Joe -- those are their actual names, I'm not even joking -- they stand out because, while they weren't central to any particular humiliations, they were cute. It wasn't for many years why I wanted them to come to my party so bad. The several kids who were all named Sean -- those were the dickbags around which humiliations centered -- I won't hesitate to say, they weren't cute. There was a Dave in there, and a Bob, too (obviously -- how could there not be). Holy shit I forgot about Mike Schofield. I'm so proud I forgot about that human trash pile. I thought his name was Sean; it was only when I dug deep looking for that name that I remembered. I hope he's having a terrible life.

How did I get on this? I was intending to talk about ghosts.

Why was I unable to identify that these people were shit bags? I mean, I understand now, but, like, jeez. It would've been nice if I had a parent that was like, "hey do you think these kids are maybe not nice?"

I don't know why you didn't text on NYE 2021. If it was because you're just kinda good to go, had enough N.E.W. for the time being, that's fine, I get it. By all accounts, I'm apparently kind of ... a lot. Let me know, though, so I can take all this stuff down.
