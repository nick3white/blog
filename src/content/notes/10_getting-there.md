Two years ago, New Years Eve, you didn't call or text. I wasn't sure if this was an intentional decision to just let it go, or if you just got old and went to bed early. I've been thinking about it ever since. When I first learned all these things, yours was the name that circled my head like birds in a cartoon when a character gets knocked out.

I could've reached out, but I'm glad I didn't. Back then, I was too overwhelmed; while I was starting to understand how I had impacted you, I was still hung up on how I had impacted everyone, and you, back then, you were a shield for me, and, two years ago, when I wanted to reach out, I was reaching for a shield.

I wanted you to go back in time and explain to everyone why I was so weird. I felt confident you would understand -- you always did -- but it was always your perception, your magnanimity, your intuition; you weren't a shield for me; I was ballast for you.

And I think some part of me knew that. I think I knew I was that for everyone -- that's why I tried my best to just float everywhere, touching nothing, impacting nothing. But I wasn't floating, I was haunting.
