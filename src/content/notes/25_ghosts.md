I've always felt like a ghost. I felt infinitely distant from everyone, no matter how close, I never felt like I was a part of...anything. I chalked it up to moving around a lot; everywhere I went, everyone had already decided on their community and weren't interested in new members. It was startling to see newcomers be welcomed; I didn't always respond well when that happened. Sometimes resentment, sometimes I just isolated and retreated further. Alone made sense; it was what I was used to. Maybe I thought that, having not grown up with a sense of community, made me incapable of feeling close to anyone. That wasn't it, but I understand why I thought that.

On the positive side, being so far away, I was without substance. That tracked, because I was nothing but clouds inside. There were so many fundamental things I didn't understand, not just about the people around me, but about myself. I was so smart in a lot of ways, but also so incredibly dumb in so many more. The real issue was that I had no idea where the parameters were; I didn't know what I could trust and what I couldn't. Again, I was lucky to be alone, because it didn't matter; the only person inconvenienced was me, and I had plenty of time to figure it all out.

It was occasionally weird when people would insinuate that I wasn't insubstantial, that I was capable of impacting the world and the people around me, and, in fact, I did it kind of a lot. Sometimes I would have panic attacks at the idea that they weren't just fucking with me, that it was real. Just in case, I would pretend to be human. I had a few masks I could wear, enough to get me by in most situations. It was hard sometimes -- I remember sitting with a guy named Russ or Russel or something like that, we were going over lines for a play, and, this guy, he was the sweetest, nicest person ever, and he was in the middle of practicing acting, so he was dipping in and out of himself and this character, I lost track of what was real, this thing I heard about cats when I was a kid bubbled up from inside me, I had never had a panic attack that bad, and to this day, I have no idea whether I kept my face as flat as I tried to, or whether the tunnelache and reality tracing was so powerful as to become visible.

Cats, I was told, sleep most of the time, because, for them, the dream world is the real world, and the world we consider real is what they consider their dreams. That notion has floated along with me my entire life. Not that it might be true -- it both can't be and can't be proven or even meaningfully discussed -- the issue is, reality may not actually have legs. It might not have a foundation. It feels as likely as not that one day someone will show me that none of this ever happened.

I was unknowable. I was incapable of knowing myself, so I instinctively assumed no one else could understand me either. I didn't understand that people are sense-making machines; whether they are right or wrong, whether they are capable of being right, their brains will try, and they'll come up with something, and if you give them only weird scraps, what they come up with will be weird, and scrappy.

Also, I wasn't actually ethereal. I impacted a lot of stuff. I didn't realize it, or I denied it, or blamed others, or a fluke, maybe a trick of the light, too much caffeine.

But you -- it was different around you.

Being around you was inspiring. Not only was everything you did imbued with beauty, but what you saw in me was beautiful. You weren't the first person in my life to think of me fondly, but you were the first person whose vision of me was legitimately, objectively beautiful. Wrong, of course (I was barely even real), but beautiful. You made me feel like I was beautiful -- and I was, but I was beautiful (I thought) in the way music is beautiful. You were the musician, I was the notes. I was magical, but you were the magician.

I mistreated a lot of people back then, from random strangers to close friends, all because I didn't think I was capable of interacting with the world. And I know that's hard to believe -- it sounds like a really elaborate excuse -- but it all makes sense to me now. I hope, by the end of this monstrosity, it does to you, too.
