I've been a fan of Polvo since the first moment I heard them.  It was probably 1996, and I noticed their album cover for Today's Active Lifestyles at the record store, and the album name captured something that had been tugging at me.  I pointed it out to the friend I was with (Ben), and, being a young person who knew all music, knew Polvo, andhe said I would probably like it.

I did.  My Kimono - the third track on Today's Active Lifestyles - is still one of my favorite songs of all time.  

Getting the basics

My Kimono's relationship with our expectations is what I vibrates with me the most.  It's so comfortable with itself, and it seems fundamentally unaware of its distance 

The main guitar line feels so practiced that its almost absent, checked out, robotic, but, at the same time, its so familiar with itself that it seems comfortable,
