I don’t think I’ve kept a regular blog since LiveJournal, which probably stopped 15 years ago or more.

What I have been doing, which I perpetually regret, is making long, painstaking replies to obscure comments on reddit – comments that will likely be read by one person, at most – but which, I believe, do carry some value.

Additionally, I’ve been using Twitter to post songs that come on that I’ve particularly enjoyed. I had very few followers. Twitter is a terrible platform, and it’s a uniquely terrible platform for music sharing, and recently, as I’m sure you’ve heard, Twitter (Xitter) has made a series of public announcements suggesting that they would prefer to make their platform even worse.

I also had a secret twitter account that I used to write poems. I don’t know if I’ll carry that here. I’ll talk about why at some point, but not right now.

The world needs a new LiveJournal.

In closing, here’s a song that came on today that I had forgotten about.
